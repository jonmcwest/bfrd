# Blatchford UI Developer test

To demonstrate your front-end technical skills, please create a simple web application using this shell codebase.

The application should (ideally) be built using vanilla JavaScript with custom CSS (although the vite configuration already has Tailwind included).

Your objective is to fetch and list characters (max 10) from the Star Wars franchise. A design has been provided for a Top Trumps style app.

Axure design: https://app.axure.cloud/app/project/r6okqj/preview/2mpa5m OR
https://r6okqj.axshare.com/?id=2mpa5m&sc=0

API endpoint: https://swapi.dev 
(open API - no authentication required)

Do as much as you can in 1 hour.


## Please note

We are not expecting a fully functional, polished application. Just show us what you can do, your approach and be prepared to talk about it, including ideas for how you would improve it.

Try and focus on Code Quality and Best Practice.
